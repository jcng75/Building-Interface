# Building-Interface
In my Assembly Class, we were given the task to utilize a data structure that can do the following:
1) Create a building
2) Remove a building
3) Lease a unit
4) Unlease a unit
5) Rent Roll
6) Occupancy Report

The building was a structure that was required to have the a name, a set number of units, and occupancy percentage.
The unit was also a structure that was required to have a tenant name, a rent ammount, and a value to determine if it's occupied or not.

The Rent Roll procedure takes a building name as a parameter and displays each occupied tenant 
name with the total amount of rent and occupancy percentage for the building.

The Occupancy Report simply displays the percentages of each building's occupancy as well as the total occupancy percentage as a whole for all buildings.

There were some minor bugs with the assembler, but this can be resolved later.  Enjoy!
